# Embbeded Systems Personal Work
I have a few things going on here in parallel, both with learning languages in a deeper level and playing around with dev boards and breadboards for embedded projects.
## LearnCPP
I can't recommend learncpp.com enough, it has helped me dial in on OOP in a deeper sense with a compiled language. Before, with Python I was just throwing objects at problems, but I now realize with C++, I can simplify my code complexity so much JUST from the correct implementation of classes.

## At Home Embedded Projects
### Blinky (Starting Project for ESP32 toolchain iteration) - GPIO registers and mechanical debouncing
