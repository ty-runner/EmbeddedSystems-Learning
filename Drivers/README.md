This is a stash of the hardware drivers I have worked on to further my firmware knowledge.

# DHT11 Temperature Sensor, half duplex driver

Using the [DHT11 Sensor Datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/758/DHT11-Technical-Data-Sheet-Translated-Version-1143054.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOopYyIpQbWHyQOEwbU6UUyl6GhCKcvGwhau5AbW7I2dsqLuaHiVZ), I read through the documentation to understand the half duplex communication scheme of the device.

The first approach to understand the communication was to use a logic analyzer and pattern generator to visualize the response packet of the device.
